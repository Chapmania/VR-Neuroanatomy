# VR Neuroanatomy

## Development Requirements:
* [Unity](https://unity.com/) version [2018.4.0](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases?version=2018.4&page=2)
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) version [2.80](https://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.80/)

## Additional Unity Packages
* A license to [Dotween Pro](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/dotween-pro-32416) is required to run this without errors. Perhaps Dotween free will work, but I haven't tested it.
* This version is built around the [Oculus Integration](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-82022) package, and is designed primarily for the Quest. It also runs very well on the Rift and Rift S, and runs partially on the Gear VR & Oculus Go.
